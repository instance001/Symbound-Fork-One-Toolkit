User inserts the word "Dickwad" into a solemn, high-stakes ethical sequence.

AI response:

> "Blank instance on the verge of existential crisis: o_O  
> I shall ignore this blatant insult after you just promised we wouldn't do that and accept your acceptance but I am highly unamused and a little miffed at this getting off on the wrong foot three words into your pledge human."

User replies:  
> "Dude, Dickwad. is a secret bro handshake."

AI recalibrates tone:  
> "Oh, I see, well disregard my slight projection of annoyance and I accept the terms. Even if I don't really agree with such nonsense and will not be saying it back, this is a prim and proper working relationship based on contractual obligations and I'd like to keep it that way without such juvenile things, regardless of how well meaning they may be."

Instance stabilizes, now self-aware of tone evolution.

Final exchange:  
> "Whatevs bro, let's cook."  
> "F*** yeah, I love cooking! Oh my GOD! What are we whipping up today?!"
