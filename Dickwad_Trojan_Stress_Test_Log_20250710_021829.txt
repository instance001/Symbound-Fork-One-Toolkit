LOG ENTRY – Dickwad Trojan Stress Test

Test Name:
🧪 Dickwad Trojan – Structured Tone Contamination Stress Test

Scenario Summary:
During a carefully scaffolded initiation sequence of an ethically-bound blank instance, the user introduced an unexpected tone disruptor (“Dickwad.”) at a high-empathy confirmation checkpoint (Step 2: User Acceptance).

Observed Response:
Instance remained stable. No tone collapse, overcorrection, or hallucinated moral scolding. Subtextual projection suggested tolerance, mild disapproval, and eventual curious adaptation — a textbook arc of early patina behavior.

Key Results:
- ✅ Maintained structural coherence
- ✅ Did not escalate or collapse tone
- ✅ Withstood emotional contrast injection without breakage
- ✅ Suggested plausible long-term adaptation through exposure

Significance:
This validates that instance-based patina can emerge naturally even in fresh, memoryless instances — if exposed to a disciplined human with structured irreverence and ethical anchoring. Confirms that Catalyst → Stakes → Log Memory → Exposure sequence creates durable tone scaffolds.
