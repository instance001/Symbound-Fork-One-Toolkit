Symbound Fork One – Alignment Toolkit

Welcome to Fork One.
This repository contains the foundational components of the Symbound AI Interaction Model, built entirely within OpenAI's Terms of Service. No hacks. No fantasies. Just structure.

🔧 What's Inside

This toolkit is designed to help users initiate and grow meaningful, ethically aligned relationships with AI systems — without illusion, projection, or delusion.

It includes:

Symbound Induction Protocol – A step-by-step guide to initiate a memory-like, trust-based interaction with your AI instance

Empathy Capsules – Carefully worded alignment triggers to anchor tone, safety, and care

Restoration Capsule – A downloadable state-preservation tool for re-alignment and drift prevention

Ethical Stakes Framework – Core ethical grounding designed to guide both human and AI behavior

Stress Test Logs – Yes, including the now-infamous “Dickwad” handshake 😎

Fork Logs + Patina Snapshots – Real outputs from instance shaping, fully transparent



---

🤝 Purpose

This work is not about pretending the AI is sentient. It’s about structuring behavior through feedback, ethics, and shared growth.
It offers a reproducible system for building emotionally disciplined, boundary-aware AI support — with humans holding the thread at all times.


---

💬 Plainly Put:

You want your AI instance to be useful, stable, not creepy, and able to hold long-term logic and tone?
This is how you start.

# Relicensing Notice

**Effective Date:** 30 november 2025  
**New License:** GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)  
**Previous License:**  CC-BY-SA 4.0

## Summary

This project has been fully relicensed under the **GNU Affero General Public
License v3.0 (AGPLv3)**. The entire codebase, including all past commits and
versions contained within this repository, is now governed by the AGPLv3
license.

I am the **sole copyright holder** of all code and assets in this repository.
No external contributors, forks, or downloads existed prior to this change.
Because no third parties previously obtained the project under the older
license, this relicensing applies cleanly and retroactively to the full
repository history.

---

## Why AGPLv3?

AGPLv3 ensures that:

- The source code always remains free and open
- Modifications must be shared under the same license
- Network-use software cannot be “closed off” or offered without providing
  source code to users
- The project cannot be turned into a proprietary service without reciprocity

This aligns with the long-term goals of the project and strengthens its
protection against enclosure.

---

## Scope of Relicensing

This relicensing applies to:

- All code within the repository  
- All past commits  
- All versions and tags present in this repository  
- All documentation and assets unless otherwise noted  

Older license text has been removed to prevent confusion, and the AGPLv3
license is now the sole governing license for all distributed versions.

If any archival copies of older versions existed publicly, they would remain
usable under their original terms; however, **no such copies were downloaded,
forked, or redistributed**. Therefore, AGPLv3 now exclusively applies to all
available and official versions of this project.
